          <p class="lead border-top pt-5 mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">
          <p>When I was trying to lose weight and increase my muscle mass, I found myself trying to keep my calorie intake below a certain limit, and my protein intake above a certain target. I naturally began to look for foods which contribute more to my protein target than my calorie limit. This post describes the metric which I developed to find these sorts of food. I had a look around the internet, and asked some gym-obsessive type people, and I can’t find this system existing elsewhere so I thought I’d write it up here.<p>

          <p>If a food contributes equally as much to my protein goal as it contributes to my calorie limit (e.g. eating a meal of that food gets me to 10% of my calorie limit and 10% of my protein target), then I define that food to have a score of 100%. If eating some amount of a food contributes half as much to my protein goal as it does to my calorie limit, then that would have a score of 50%. Thus, I want the average score of everything I eat in a day to be 100% or higher.<p>

          <p>As everyone’s calorie limits and protein goals are unique to them, the scores for food will depend on the person. Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iz1OVyRMG2pOG_A3g21n2iHgsmMh1NwqcOshmTzbE4/edit?usp=sharing" style="color: #a657ae;">the spreadsheet</a>, make a copy of it and input your calorie and protein targets, and see how foods score for you! Copy the formula and add whatever foods you're interested in.<p>

          <p class="text-secondary">

          <p> <i>Note that all the metric percentage scores I list from now on will be for my personal targets of 2500 calories and 120g of protein. You should input your own calorie/protein targets into the spreadsheet to see how the foods score for you (of course, the relative ranking between foods won’t change, just the absolute numbers). If you don't already have targets for protein and calories, then in the next section I'll explain the basics of what to know.</i><p>

          <p>I was surprised to see that pasta has a respectable score of 75%. And was shocked to see that brown rice (46%) has a score lower than potatoes (61%)! I always thought of potatoes having effectively no protein, and that rice wasn’t bad, so I was very wrong there.<p>

          <p>Also surprising, chickpeas only just break even (103%). I often hear people use chickpeas as an example of a good vegan protein source, but for most people this is not the case (for most people who are actively trying to build muscle, but if you’re happy just getting the baseline recommendation then it’s got a great score of 182%). If you think that anything above 100% is a good protein source, don’t forget that 100% is what the final meal should be, and there will be many other components which drag the score down. A chickpea curry for example, will have many ingredients which have extremely low scores, such as oil, coconut milk, and rice, which will quickly drag the score down to well below 100%. In my mind, for something to be a good protein source it should be well above 100%, as it can be relied upon to drag other foods up in order for a meal to average out to be at least 100%. I think of anything at 150% or higher to be a good protein source, as then it can be paired with a (calorically) equal quantity of something which has a score of only 50% and the meal can still average out to break even.<p>

          <p>Some less surprising things: protein powder is apparently high in protein while low in calories (400% for pea protein), and cakes are not (22% for oreos).<p>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-12">
          <h2 class="h3 mt-5 pt-5">What should my protein target and calorie limit be?</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary">
          <p>From the little I’ve looked into, it seems as though the rough idea is that to not be deficient one should eat at least 0.8 g/kg (grams of protein per kilogram of body weight), and 1.5 g/kg is a good amount for those who are interested in building muscle mass, while those who are really serious and want to get truly ripped should probably be eating 2 g/kg (but it seems like the returns really diminish leading up to that point). (Note: for people who are overweight, it seems like it is advisable to consider your lean bodyweight, not your actual bodyweight, when doing this g/kg calculation).<p>

          <p>Regarding calories, the NHS gives the basic guideline that the average woman needs about 2000 calories per day, and the average man needs 2500. For people who are quite active and exercising regularly I would guess those numbers would become more like 2300 and 2800 respectively. Or check out this basic calorie estimator based on your height, weight, and activity level: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304" style="color: #a657ae;">Link here</a>
<p>

          <p>To take myself as an example, as I am trying to increase my muscle mass a bit, I think 1.5g per kilo of bodyweight is a reasonable protein target, and as I weigh roughly 80kg this is 1.5*80 = 120g of protein per day for me. As I am reasonably active I’m probably burning more calories than average, but as I wouldn’t mind losing a bit of weight I’ll stick with the average 2500 calories (the calculator I linked to recommends 2800, and so this will be something like a 10% calorie deficit).<p>

          <h2 class="h3 mt-5 pt-5">How I personally use the metric

          </h2>
          <p class="text-secondary">
          <p>As I don’t want to limit fruit and vegetables, I decided to ignore these from the score and eat as much of them as I want (except for those very high in carbs, such as potatoes, a grain masquerading as a vegetable).<p>

          <p>I use the metric in a very loose way, and just do a rough mental estimate to see if a meal is at 100%, or if I need to rethink it to get it there.
          E.g. if I am cooking something quite high in carbs (e.g. basmati rice, with a score of 40%), I think about what I need to add to make sure I reach my protein target before I blow over my calorie budget (e.g. tofu, with a stunning score of 232%).
          To be precise, the resulting meal’s score will be a weighted average of the scores of the components (weighted by calories, not by mass). What matters is how “far away” from 100% each of the two foods are. For the rice and tofu example, the distance between rice and 100% is 60%, and the distance between tofu and 100% is 130%. As rice’s distance is about half of tofu’s distance, we know we need about half as much tofu as rice to balance out the meal, thus a meal that has 66% of its calories from rice and 33% from tofu would be balanced.<p>

          <p>Personally, I use this incredibly loosely. I don’t count calories, and I just keep the ratio in the back of my mind when I’m cooking to try and end up with a dish that’s got a score in the ballpark of 100%, and stop eating when I’m full. If I were to try actively losing weight, then I would start being more mindful of portion sizes while continuing to keep the protein-calorie ratio in the back of my mind. <p>

          <p>This metric made me realise that my classic breakfast of porridge (oats at 76%), peanut butter (96%), and fruit (negligible) isn’t quite pulling its weight, and I should be making sure my other meals can compensate accordingly.<p>

          <h3 class="h6">What about protein quality?</h3>
          <p class="text-secondary">
            I will cover this in an upcoming blog post, but from what I’ve learnt so far it seems as though for normal people living in the real world (i.e. getting protein from multiple sources), the balance of amino acids is a small effect and can be safely ignored. The balance of amino acids would be relevant for people who rely on their protein from just one or two sources. If I find good information to the contrary I will add a weighting to the different protein sources in the table to adjust for this effect.

          <h2 class="h3 mt-5 pt-5">Other factors to consider</h2>
          <p class="text-secondary">
          <p>This metric obviously ignores loads of important considerations, as clearly protein and calories are not the only thing we should care about. Obviously the other macronutrients and micronutrients should also be considered. <p>

          <p>A big factor which I have found important when I try to reduce my calorie intake is thinking about how filling foods are. Foods which are calorically dense (like peanut butter, or processed food like biscuits and cake) are not very filling and I can get through a lot of it without noticing. But fibrous foods like cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli, cabbage) fill me up while being very low in calories. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15701207_A_Satiety_Index_of_common_foods" style="color: #a657ae;"> 1995 study</a> developed an index which measures the satiety (how filling foods feel) of different foods. They used white bread as the standard, and measured how much better or worse different foods are at keeping us full. The study was small (only containing 13 subjects), and so their error bars are very large, resulting in a lot of their measurements overlapping, so their results shouldn’t be taken too seriously, but it’s still worth looking at. Subjects were fed the same calorific quantity (240 cal) of different foods, and their subjective level of hunger was measured over the next 2 hours. The Satiety Index (SI) of white bread was defined to be 100%, and everything else was compared to that.<p>

          <p>For example, white pasta scores slightly better than brown pasta in my protein metric (75% vs 73%), but brown pasta’s SI is 50% higher than white pasta (188% vs 119%)! So this has made me definitely prioritise brown pasta over white pasta. Apples and oranges (turns out they can be compared after all) also scored very highly (303% ± 50% and 309% ± 52 respectively), while bananas scored only a bit better than white bread at 118% ± 27%. <p>

          <p>Here are a few other results from the study which caught my eye:<p>

        <ul>
    <li>The food with the lowest SI was croissants, with a score of 47% ± 17%</li>
    <li>In the snacks category, a Mars Bar scored 70% ± 25%, peanuts were 84% ± 19%, and popcorn was 154% ± 40%
</li>
    <li>Breakfast items were interesting, with muesli (100% ± 23%) and cornflakes (118%  ± 19%) performing averagely, and with porridge being the runaway winner (209% ± 36%).
</li>
    <li>However, the standout winner was the humble potato with a whopping score of 323% ± 51%! so even though their score in my protein metric is pretty mediocre at 52%, these are still a good choice (of course with a complementary portion of something high in protein to drag the score to 100%). Note that the method of preparation matters, as the score above is for boiled potatoes, while for chips (aka french fries) the score was 116 ± 35. (And no, despite what it sounds like, this post is not sponsored by the  <a href="https://irishpotatofederation.ie/about/" style="color: #a657ae;">Irish Potato Federation</a>).

          <p class="text-secondary">
          <p>Of course, this metric only helps you optimise the ratio of protein to calories, but to make sure that you are staying under your calorie limit, you will need to keep track of this separately.<p>

          <p>It is obvious that I am not an expert, and to educate myself I just read a few blogs, papers, and chatted to my gym-obsessed colleagues. But I am quite confident that all of the claims I have stated here are non-controversial (except maybe the paragraph on protein quality, but I will be explaining my reasoning in more detail later on).<p>

          <p>Due to the <a href="https://muddyclothes.substack.com/p/what-the-fuck" style="color: #a657ae;">terrible</a> <a href="https://muddyclothes.substack.com/p/no-injuries-were-reported" style="color: #a657ae;">ways</a> <a href="https://benthams.substack.com/p/factory-farming-delenda-est" style="color: #a657ae;">that</a> <a href="https://benthams.substack.com/p/the-common-sense-view-on-meat-implies" style="color: #a657ae;">farmed</a> <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/factory-farming-animal-cruelty" style="color: #a657ae;">animals</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDJlEQsDoA&ab_channel=FarmTransparencyProject" style="color: #a657ae;">treated</a>, I have not included any animals in the spreadsheet. However, as the first question of many of my non-vegan gym friends was how does chicken-meat/cow-meat score, I thought I should include it here: cow meat with 15% fat scores 216% (high, but I was surprised to see it lower than tofu’s 232%), and chicken breast meat once its skin and bones have been removed scores up at protein-powder heights of 421%. I wish this would go without saying, but I think this convenience does not justify the suffering that is forced upon the animals.<p>

          <p class="text-secondary">
          <p>This metric is a way of measuring the ratio of calories-protein a food contains and relating that to an individual’s goals. I have found this metric to be helpful in guiding my thinking about foods in the context of keeping energy intake low and protein intake high in the context of losing weight and gaining muscle. There are many other factors to consider when eating a balanced diet, including micronutrients, macronutrients other than protein, satiety, and probably things which I know almost nothing about such as the glycaemic index.<p>
